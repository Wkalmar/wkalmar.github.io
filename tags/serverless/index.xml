      <description>Concept Observing signs of russo-Ukrainian war fatigue I decided to come up with a poem called &amp;ldquo;Is the war over?&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve labeled it as poésie concrète drawing an analogy with musique concrète - genre where music is composed of non-musical pieces of sound.
In the same way, my poem is composed of search engine results for &amp;ldquo;russian war crimes&amp;rdquo; in the latest week which are then processed by a sentiment analysis model to extract sentences that highlight russian atrocities most properly.</description>

      <description>When I was playing around with my pet-project Kyiv Station Walk I’ve noticed that manually removing test data is tedious and I need to come up with a concept of the admin page. This required some sort of authentication endpoint. Some super-lightweight service which would check login and password against as a pair of super-user credentials.
Serverless is quite useful for this simple nanoservice. This brings some cost-saving as serverless comes to me almost free due to low execution rate that I anticipate for the admin page of my low-popular service.</description>
