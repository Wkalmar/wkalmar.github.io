      <description>Back in the looney days before russian full-scale invasion, I&amp;rsquo;ve used to travel a lot domestically and internationally. Also at that time, I had a Nokia Lumia phone with a nice widget that displayed the locations of the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on a map. I enjoyed looking at it realizing how big is the world and how much I have to travel in order to discover it.
While I have a similar widget in my Android phone I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with its look and feel.</description>
