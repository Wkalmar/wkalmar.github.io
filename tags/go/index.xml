      <description>When I was playing around with my pet-project Kyiv Station Walk Iâ€™ve noticed that manually removing test data is tedious and I need to come up with a concept of the admin page. This required some sort of authentication endpoint. Some super-lightweight service which would check login and password against as a pair of super-user credentials.
Serverless is quite useful for this simple nanoservice. This brings some cost-saving as serverless comes to me almost free due to low execution rate that I anticipate for the admin page of my low-popular service.</description>
