<p>One of the pet projects I was involved in has quite a bigger scale than the other ones. Multiple people were involved in it and it spanned over a couple of years. In such circumstances, technical debt tends to accumulate. So I&rsquo;ve decided to give NDepend a go to see if it can improve the state of affairs.</p>

<h2 id="strategical-view">Strategical view</h2>

<p>Before trying out this tool I&rsquo;ve heard from my colleagues that NDepend is a tool to visualize project dependencies so I started off with visualizing the project graph. Since the solution is pretty big the result was a diagram with really a lot of parts that looks as below. I don&rsquo;t expect that you will figure out something from it at this point.</p>

<p><img src="/16/1.PNG" width="600"/></p>

<p>However, upon careful examination, I&rsquo;ve noticed a suspicious thing that one might overlook if there is no clear visualization present.</p>

<p><img src="/16/2.PNG" width="600"/></p>

<p>In the picture above you can see that the domain level depends on the data access level (named DataModel) which is pretty suspicious since ideally domain should present core business logic free from any dependencies. Turned out that during years of development, not all people on the team had a clear understanding of this concept and used the domain level as a junkyard for various DTOs. In this article, I won&rsquo;t provide any further details on how this was fixed since it&rsquo;s an ongoing process.</p>

<p>So as you can see, there&rsquo;s no magic button &ldquo;make my architecture correct&rdquo; in NDepend, since architectures are born different but visual examination can give you some insights that you might not have noticed otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="tactical-view">Tactical view</h2>

<p>With that done I&rsquo;ve decided to explore other capabilities of NDepend. Apart from visualizing dependencies, it allows you to perform code analysis.</p>

<p>So as you can judge from the screenshot codebase is in pretty good shape.</p>

<p><img src="/16/3.PNG" width="600"/></p>

<p>However, some rules are violated. Naturally, I&rsquo;ve started with more critical ones. One of them is <a href="https://www.ndepend.com/default-rules/NDepend-Rules-Explorer.html?ruleid=ND1003#!">Avoid methods too big, too complex</a>. In my case, it could be remediated by <a href="https://refactoring.guru/extract-method">Extract method</a>.</p>

<p>Another critical rule violation that I&rsquo;ve found in my codebase is <a href="https://www.ndepend.com/default-rules/NDepend-Rules-Explorer.html?ruleid=ND1000#!">Avoid types too big</a>. Just as I expected types that are listed as too big are the same types that violate <a href="https://www.ndepend.com/default-rules/NDepend-Rules-Explorer.html?ruleid=ND1007#!">Avoid types with poor cohesion</a>. So, in this case, the fix was pretty straightforward: split big classes into classes with more fine-grained responsibilities that in turn will be more cohesive.</p>

<p>Again, NDepend, as any other code analyzer (i.e. SonarCube) helps you spot places where you show a lack of discipline in applying clean code techniques to your codebase.</p>

<h2 id="further-work">Further work</h2>

<p>The fixes I&rsquo;ve applied were mostly sporadic since a lot of effort was spent to deliver new features but another nice option is to <a href="https://www.ndepend.com/docs/teamcity-integration-ndepend">integrate NDepend with Teamcity</a> in order to continuously monitor code quality changes.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it to the reader to decide whether this tool is worth purchasing a license. But I&rsquo;ll say that NDepend is a nice tool that helps to oversee the strategic direction your project heads towards as well as tactical implementation details.</p>
