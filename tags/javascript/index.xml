      <description>Concept Observing signs of russo-Ukrainian war fatigue I decided to come up with a poem called &amp;ldquo;Is the war over?&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve labeled it as poésie concrète drawing an analogy with musique concrète - genre where music is composed of non-musical pieces of sound.
In the same way, my poem is composed of search engine results for &amp;ldquo;russian war crimes&amp;rdquo; in the latest week which are then processed by a sentiment analysis model to extract sentences that highlight russian atrocities most properly.</description>

      <description>Back in the looney days before russian full-scale invasion, I&amp;rsquo;ve used to travel a lot domestically and internationally. Also at that time, I had a Nokia Lumia phone with a nice widget that displayed the locations of the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on a map. I enjoyed looking at it realizing how big is the world and how much I have to travel in order to discover it.
While I have a similar widget in my Android phone I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with its look and feel.</description>

      <description>Introduction Typescript starts to gain more and more popularity because of static typing offering its benefits. Still, some developers who are involved in supporting projects with angular.js may be stuck with lack of community offering their recipes of using angular.js together with typescript. This article will try to fill this gap.
Our strategy involves shipping working product at every stage of development. So in real life, transition to typescript can be performed gradually thus not hurting business goals that development team has to reach.</description>
